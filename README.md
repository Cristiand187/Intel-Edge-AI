*Intel® Edge AI Scholarship Program*

Join the community
We’ve created a custom Slack workspace for your Intel® Edge AI Foundation Course classmates and you.

In this exclusive student community, experts from the Udacity team will be able to answer your questions and provide technical advice. What’s more, you can use the Slack workspace to collaborate with and get support from classmates or ask questions to our team of Community Managers. Below is the auto-invite link to join the Slack community:

If you’re new to Slack, don’t worry. You’ll find it’s super easy to learn and that it’s a great way to communicate with other students.

For any questions related to the Foundation course, please refer to the Google site.
